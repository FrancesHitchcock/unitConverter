# Unit Converter
A Scrimba project to practise skills learned in the JavaScript Fundamentals course

## Aims
To use event listeners to build a unit conversion app with UI based on a Figma design file. 

## Skills Demonstrated
- addEventListener()
- input.value
- function parameters
- template strings
- innerHTML
- addition assignment operator
- objects as array items
- label for form element to enhance accessibility

## Response
The focus was on producing efficient, clear code using a stateless function handleConversion(). The const numberOfUnits is declared within the function and passed as an argument to render() rather than being declared as a let variable in global scope.
The render() function employs pure helper functions getUnitString() and calculateValue(). 
ChatGPT was used as an additional learning tool to suggest and explain improvements for refactoring.

## Opportunities for Development
There is the potential for a spin-off project to calculate BMI information using NHS guidelines for the healthy BMI range. This should also use JSON objects and localStorage so that the user's height measurement can persist across sessions.
